A CLI utility and Python library for interacting with Large Language Models, including OpenAI, PaLM and local models installed on your own machine.

Full documentation: **[llm.datasette.io](https://llm.datasette.io/)**

Background on this project:
- [llm, ttok and strip-tagsâ€”CLI tools for working with ChatGPT and other LLMs](https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/18/cli-tools-for-llms/)
- [The LLM CLI tool now supports self-hosted language models via plugins](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/12/llm/)
- [Accessing Llama 2 from the command-line with the llm-replicate plugin](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jul/18/accessing-llama-2/)

## Installation

Install this tool using `pip`:
```bash
pip install llm
```
Or using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
brew install llm
```
[Detailed installation instructions](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/setup.html).

## Getting started

If you have an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) you can get started using the OpenAI models right away.

As an alternative to OpenAI, you can [install plugins](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/plugins/installing-plugins.html) to access models by other providers, including models that can be installed and run on your own device.

Save your OpenAI API key like this:

```bash
llm keys set openai
```
This will prompt you for your key like so:
```bash
llm keys set openai
```
```
Enter key: <paste here>
```
Now that you've saved a key you can run a prompt like this:
```bash
llm "Five cute names for a pet penguin"
```
```
1. Waddles
2. Pebbles
3. Bubbles
4. Flappy
5. Chilly
```
Read the [usage instructions](https://llm.datasette.io/en/stable/usage.html) for more.

## Using a system prompt

You can use the `-s/--system` option to set a system prompt, providing instructions for processing other input to the tool.

To describe how the code a file works, try this:

```bash
cat mycode.py | llm -s "Explain this code"
```

## Help

For help, run:

    llm --help

You can also use:

    python -m llm --help
