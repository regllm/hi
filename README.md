Access large language models from the command-line

## Installation

Install this tool using `pip`:

    pip install llm

You need an OpenAI API key, which should either be set in the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, or saved in a plain text file called `~/.openai-api-key.txt` in your home directory.

## Usage

So far this tool only has one command - `llm chatgpt`. You can just use `llm` as this is the default command.

To run a prompt:

    llm 'Ten names for cheesecakes'

To stream the results a token at a time:

    llm 'Ten names for cheesecakes' -s

To switch from ChatGPT 3.5 (the default) to GPT-4 if you have access:

    llm 'Ten names for cheesecakes' -4

Pass `--model <model name>` to use a different model.

## Help

For help, run:

    llm --help

You can also use:

    python -m llm --help
