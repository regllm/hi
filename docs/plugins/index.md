# Plugins

LLM plugins can enhance LLM by making alternative Large Language Models available, either via API or by running the models locally on your machine.

Plugins can also add new commands to the `llm` CLI tool.

The {ref}`plugin directory <plugin-directory>` lists available plugins that you can install and use.

{ref}`tutorial-model-plugin` describes how to build a new plugin in detail.
