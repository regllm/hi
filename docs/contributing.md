# Contributing

To contribute to this tool, first checkout the code. Then create a new virtual environment:

    cd llm
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

Or if you are using `pipenv`:

    pipenv shell

Now install the dependencies and test dependencies:

    pip install -e '.[test]'

To run the tests:

    pytest

## Debugging tricks

The default OpenAI plugin has a debugging mechanism for showing the exact responses that came back from the OpenAI API.

Set the `OPENAI_LOG` environment variable like this:
```bash
OPENAI_LOG=debug llm -m chatgpt 'three word slogan for an an otter-run bakery'
```
This will output details of the API request to the console.

## Documentation

Documentation for this project uses [MyST](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/) - it is written in Markdown and rendered using Sphinx.

To build the documentation locally, run the following:

    cd docs
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    make livehtml

This will start a live preview server, using [sphinx-autobuild](https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-autobuild/).

The CLI `--help` examples in the documentation are managed using [Cog](https://github.com/nedbat/cog). Update those files like this:

    just cog

You'll need [Just](https://github.com/casey/just) installed to run this command.

## Release process

1. Update `docs/changelog.md` with the new changes.
